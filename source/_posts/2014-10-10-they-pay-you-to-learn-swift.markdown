{% img left /images/topcoderswift.png %} So I was trying to find something to do in Swift. I thought, maybe I should work on some simple, dummy apps to hone my skills. I was considering a few ideas, but then I got a mail from [Topcoder](http://www.topcoder.com/?action=callback&utm_source=palewar&utm_campaign=ReferralProgram) announcing their [GetSwifter](http://swift.topcoder.com/?action=callback&utm_source=palewar&utm_campaign=ReferralProgram) series. It basically is a series of development challenges in Swift. They have decided to distribute $500,000 as prizes. <!-- more --> I checked out their Swift Challenges and found that they were mostly some simple apps. They keep posting a few challenges every week and typical time to complete the challenges is about 4-6 days. I found this very interesting and started working on a few challenges.

They just finished distributing $100,000 to 1000 people. It was a very simple challenge to get started. They just wanted participants to create a playground file and intention was to test that we have understood basics in Swift and can write and use Classes, Structures, Arrays, Tuples etc. I participated in this challenge and was successful in earning my first prize at Topcoder. They basically gave $100 to first 1000 people who completed the challenge successfully.

While this simple challenge is already over, not so simple and some real-world challenges are in progress and more challenges are being added regularly so I urge all of you to checkout [Swift Challenges](http://swift.topcoder.com/?action=callback&utm_source=palewar&utm_campaign=ReferralProgram) on [Topcoder](http://www.topcoder.com/?action=callback&utm_source=palewar&utm_campaign=ReferralProgram) right now and start participating. It's really a good way to learn Swift and in these crazy times, you get paid to learn it, so make the most of it.

For those interested in the $100 Playground challenge, I am sharing my solution [^1] below, it may be of help to others. Don't worry about so many lines. Most of it is comments. Comments basically are instructions for participants on what needs to be done. Solution to the problem follows the comment. 

I found myself referring [Apple's Swift Book](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-XID_454) many times to get the concepts right for each of these problems. Getting the Generics right took sometime and I also referred good old [StackOverFlow](http://stackoverflow.com) a few times, specially to get the random number generation right.

Everything should be self-explanatory, but let me know if you don't understand anything.

[^1]: I am sharing my solution since the contest is already over. I have also reached out to Topcoder over Twitter and email for clarifications regarding any violations. I haven't heard back from them, but I don't intend to violate any terms & conditions and if I will be made aware that it's not ok to share the code from contest entry like this, I am ready to remove it from here.
