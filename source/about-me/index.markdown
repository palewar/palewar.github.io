I am Sachin Palewar from India. I started as freelance programmer in 1999 with Visual Basic and created several desktop applications for local clients. Automating AutoCAD and Adobe Flash using their COM libs in my projects were some of the interesting things I did. My favorite work was a project which used to generate L-Section and Cross Section AutoCAD drawings of proposed roads using the data fed into the system by surveyors.

After that I started a software company with close friends in [Nagpur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur), India and we developed softwares for Windows Mobile and Palm OS platforms.  My company was one of the  highly ranked company on outsourcing website rentacoder.com  (now acquired by freelancer.com). We worked for clients from all over the globe, specially US, Australia and UK. 

We migrated to developing for iOS and Android when they became the dominant mobile platforms. I developed an iPhone app back in 2010 named 'Indian Holidays' which was one of the  Top 10 Free App in Indian App Store for a few days. In 2011 we got an [award of USD 15,000 from Intel AppUp](http://www.tizenexperts.com/2011/10/intel-appup-developer-challenge-winners/) App Store for our Windows App 'Unit Converter'. In 2012 we worked on an iOS App called [LoYakk](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/loyakk/id482533084?mt=8) for one of our clients, this App  won ['Race for Apps'](https://ictomorrow.innovateuk.org/web/race-for-apps-contest) during London Olympics . We also did some [Android](https://prezi.com/1jaunt3kwdt8/amba-android-app/) & [Windows Phone](http://allaboutwindowsphone.com/software/developer/Palewar-Techno-Solutions.php) Apps.

I ran the company for 11 yrs. till Oct 2014 and then decided to step away and try out something else, something good, something different. While I am figuring out what to do, I spend my time learning Swift and doing some freelance consulting. I will be happy to talk about any collaboration and contribution opportunities with readers of this blog.
